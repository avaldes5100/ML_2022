2014 Results

PepsiCo grew constant-currency adjusted earnings-per-share 9% in 2014. Coca-Cola grew constant-currency adjusted earnings-per share 7.9% in 2014. 

PepsiCo and Coca-Cola focused on similar initiatives in 2014. Both are focusing on running more efficient operations. Both are growing in developing and emerging markets.

PepsiCo has the edge over Coca-Cola because of its Frito-Lay chips brands. The company's chips brands continue to see volume increases in stagnating developed markets.

This growth is in contrast to trends in drinks. Consumers are slowly switching from unhealthy sodas to healthier beverage alternatives. For example, a consumer may switch from a Coca-Cola soda every morning to an Honest Tea. Either way, you are still buying from the same company. Interestingly, consumers have not yet applied the health logic that is causing soda sales to stagnate to chip brands. PepsiCo's Frito-Lay division grew volume 2% in North America in 2014.
