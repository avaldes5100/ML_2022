The company increased its sales volume in both snacks and beverages during the period. Its biggest revenue gains came from overseas, with Europe reporting a 37 percent revenue increase because of higher prices and the addition of Wimm-Bill-Dann. Revenue for Asia, the Middle East and Africa rose 25 percent on increased prices and volume growth, particularly in emerging markets. The Latin America Foods unit posted a 19 percent increase in revenue, led by Mexico and Brazil.
